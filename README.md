# Block Sponsor Comments

## Browser extension to remove sponsors from youtube descriptions and comments.

A browser extension that removes a preset list of video sponsors from youtube video descriptions and comments.

Meant to be used in combination with [Sponsorblock](http://sponsor.ajay.app). 
I fully endorse this extension being integrated/merged with any other application with or without credit (Looking at you, Sponsorblock ;P)
